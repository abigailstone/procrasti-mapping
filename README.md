# "Procrasti-mapping"

A collection of miscellaneous mapping projects.  

I call these projects my "procrasti-mapping" projects because they're not particularly polished, and I often use them to practice a new tool or play with a dataset. They occasionally distract me from real responsibilities, hence the portmanteau of "procrastination" and "mapping".
